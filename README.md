# Bitstyles

A developing collection of CSS styles and helpers, for use in Bitcrowd projects.

This will be included in projects using [Bower](http://bower.io/) or
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).


## Installation

Bitstyles can be installed via `npm` or `bower`, as each project demands.

The source repository is currently private, and is not registered with the Bower
or npm registries. You will therefore need to install directly from a tagged
Github release (not from master), and you will need read access to the repo.

### Bower
```
$ bower install git@github.com:bitcrowd/bitstyles.git#v0.1.2-alpha
```

### npm
```
$ npm install git+ssh://github.com/bitcrowd/bitstyles.git#v0.1.2-alpha
```
