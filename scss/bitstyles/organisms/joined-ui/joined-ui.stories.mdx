# Joined UI

A collection of interactive elements that are closely-related can be visually bound together.

Commonly, this layout is used for buttons. See [Joined buttons](/docs/ui-buttons-joined-overview--page) for more examples:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="ui-buttons-joined--pagination-outline" />
</Canvas>

The `joined-ui` is also used for grouping closely-related inputs & buttons. See [Filtering](/docs/ui-data-filtering--filter-by-free-text) for more examples:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="ui-data-filtering--filter-by-free-text" />
</Canvas>
