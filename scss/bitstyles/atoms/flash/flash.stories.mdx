# Flash

A flash informs the user of a global or important event, such as a successful (or unsuccessful!) login, server error, network connection issues etc.

When used inside a discrete block of UI (like a [card](/docs/atoms-card--card)), flashes are also useful for more context-specific event notifications. As they’re quite attention-grabbing and permanent, flashes are most suitable for use for important messaging.

Flashes have several variants, which use color to indicate severity or intention. The default configuration provides `brand-1`, `grayscale`, `positive`, `warning`, and `danger` flashes, all using colors from the global color theme system. Using the theme system means that any buttons or other components placed inside a flash will be correctly colored.

Since you’re providing the user feedback, it is very likely that your flashes should be rendered inside an `aria-live` region.

Apply a theme to each flash in the usual way (see [Themes](/docs/design-tokens-themes--page)). Customize the themes to customize the flash color variants available to you.

With default configuration, flashes share the global `content` padding design tokens for horizontal padding, meaning the content inside a flash aligns correctly to the rest of your content, and is responsive. See [customization](#customization) below for details on how to change that.

Examples here show the content of the flashes within a [content](/docs/atoms-content-content) wrapper to produce standard spacing, and restrict the content width so it aligns with other page content. You don't need to use these if it doesn’t fit your design requirements.

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story id="atoms-flash--base" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--positive" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--warning" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--danger" />
</Canvas>

## With icons

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story id="atoms-flash--base-icon" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--positive-icon" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--warning-icon" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--danger-icon" />
</Canvas>

## With buttons

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story id="atoms-flash--base-icon-button" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--positive-icon-button" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--warning-icon-button" />
  <Story id="atoms-flash--danger-icon-button" />
</Canvas>

## Customization

You can adjust the vertical padding and the gap applied between child elements of the flash (e.g. icon, text, and close/dismiss button). If you need to adjust the horizontal padding for flashes, it is recommended to adjust the padding for the `content` design tokens, so that all your content will be correctly aligned - see the [content documentation](/docs/design-tokens-content--page). If you need flash content to be aligned differently to other content, you can still edit the horizontal padding here.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/setup';
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/tools/size';
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/atoms/flash' with (
  $size-variants: (
    '#{setup.$no-media-query}': (
      'padding-vertical': size.get('s3'),
      'gap': size.get('s3'),
    ),
    'l': (
      'padding-vertical': size.get('l1'),
      'gap': size.get('l5'),
    ),
  )
);
```
