# Flash

A flash informs the user of a global or important event, such as a successful (or unsuccessful!) login, server error, network connection issues etc. When used inside a discrete block of UI like a [card](/docs/atoms-card--card), Flashes are also useful for more context-specific event notifications.

Flashes come in several variants, which use color **and html** attributes to indicate severity. By default you have `brand-1`, `positive`, `warning`, and `danger`, which use those colors from the global color palette. See the [Customization](#customization) section below for details on how to change those defaults.

Examples here show the content of the flashes within a [content](/docs/atoms-content-content) wrapper to produce standard spacing, and restrict the content width so it aligns with other page content. You don't need to use these if it doesnâ€™t fit your design requirements.

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story name="a-flash--brand-1">
    {`
      <div class="u-padding-l2-y a-flash--brand-1" aria-live="polite">
        <div class="a-content">
          Changes successfully saved
        </div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="a-flash--positive">
    {`
      <div class="u-padding-l2-y a-flash--positive" aria-live="polite">
        <div class="a-content">
          Changes successfully saved
        </div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="a-flash--warning">
    {`
      <div class="u-padding-l2-y a-flash--warning" aria-live="polite">
        <div class="a-content">
          Login not successful, please try that again
        </div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="a-flash--danger">
    {`
      <div class="u-padding-l2-y a-flash--danger" role="alert">
        <div class="a-content">
          An error occured, please contact an admin
        </div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

The available variants can be specified with `$variants`, where the strings you pass must match colors in your color palette:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/atoms/flash' with (
  $variants: (
    'brand-1',
    'positive',
    'danger',
    'warning',
  )
);
```

The keys from those colors that will be used are specified with the `$color` and `$background-color`, and are applied to all variants. With the following settings, the `positive` variant will have color `positive` value `90`, with background color `positive` value `10`. The `danger` variant will have color `danger` with value `90` and background-color `danger` at value `10` etc,

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/atoms/flash' with (
  $color: '90';
  $background-color: '10';
);
```
