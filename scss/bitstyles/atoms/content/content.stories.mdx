# Content

A content wrapper to ensure content is a readable width, and has space to the sides of the viewport.

This class ensures there is always whitespace at the sides of the viewport, so any content inside will never touch the edge.

Content will span the full width of the viewport, up to a maximum set by `$bitstyles-content-max-width`. This means that in small viewports your content will use all the available width. In larger viewports your content will stop growing once it reaches the limit of what is comfortably readable, and not keep growing infintely.

Whatever the size of the viewport, content will remain centered.

If this class is used on an element with less than viewport-width, the above conditions will be relative to its parent element instead of the viewport.
