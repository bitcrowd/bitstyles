# Link

Links navigate the user to another URL. They are the magic sauce that made the web web-like, and are one of the original HTML elements: `<a>`. Where possible, you should use these anchor elements for your links, using the `href` attribute to provide the URL to navigate to. When doing this, you donâ€™t need any extra classes, just the semantic HTML:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="base-anchor--base" />
</Canvas>

## Buttons as links

You may sometimes want to mimic the appearance of a standard anchor element in some other interactive element e.g. a `<button>` that needs to look like a link. You can do this by applying the `a-link` classname:

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story id="atoms-link--button-as-link" />
</Canvas>
