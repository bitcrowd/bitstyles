# Link

Mimic the appearance of a standard anchor element by applying a classname. This allows other interactive elements (e.g. `<button>`) to visually match your links.

This is a slightly bad practice — if it looks like a link, it should be a link — that’s sometimes necessary for technical reasons, generally when building a JS app. Actions triggered by JavaScript should not use anchor elements because no navigation occurs, instead they should use `button` elements. But sometimes that button needs to look like a link (examples are the trigger to displaying a modal, or a smaller de-emphasised cancel button next to your primary “OK” action).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Link">
    {`
      <button class="a-link" type="button">A button element</button>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
