# Link

Mimic the appearance of standard anchor elements. This allows other interactive elements (e.g. `<button>`) to visually match your links.

This is generally a bad practice — if it looks like a link, it should be a link — but it’s sometimes necessary for technical reasons, especially when building a JS app e.g. an element shouldn’t be a link because no url change occurs (this could be when displaying a modal, or cancelling an action).

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Link">
    {`
      <button class="o-link" type="button">I’m a button element</button>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
