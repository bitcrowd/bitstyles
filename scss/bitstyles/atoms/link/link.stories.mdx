# Link

See [Base/Anchor](/docs/base-anchor-overview--page) for details on anchor elements.

## Buttons as links (`.a-link`)

You may sometimes want to mimic the appearance of a standard anchor element in some other interactive element e.g. a `<button>` that needs to look like a link. You can do this by applying the `a-link` classname:

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story id="atoms-link--button-as-link" />
</Canvas>
