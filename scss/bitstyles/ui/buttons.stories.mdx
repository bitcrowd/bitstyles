# Buttons

The button classes are used to make an interactive element look like a “button” to the user, and should ideally perform an action rather a navigation. For historical and technical reasons, things which we consider “actions” are actually implemented by navigating to a page (e.g. a CRUD system) so this class is often applied to `<a>` elements. Ideally though (and definitely if you’re working on a JS app) use a real `<button>` element.

All the buttons produce a larger-than-text hit target, and by default react to `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, `:disabled`, and `aria-pressed`, `aria-selected`, and `aria-current` states. Visited states are not shown even if the “button” is actually an anchor element. This is because buttons indicate actions, and “visited” doesn’t make sense for an action.

Bitstyles provides two sets of button variants — size variants, and color variants. Each of the size variants can be combined with each of the color variants to produce a wide range of button appearances.

## Shape variants

Buttons are available in a variety of shapes:

- **small**, **default**, **large** Sizes which can be combined with the other shapes.
- **square** A square button, with padding and border-radius that matches the other buttons at a given size. Useful for icon buttons.
- **round** A circular button, which matches the size of other buttons at a given size. Useful for icon buttons.

See [Button shapes](/docs/atoms-button-shapes--small) for details on customizing these.

## Color variants

- **Primary** The default button style is primary, and in most cases should be used only once per screen to indicate the primary action for the screen.
- **Secondary** The most-commonly used, these indicate all the non-primary actions a user can enact on a screen.
- **Transparent** Use transparent buttons to de-emphasise an action (see the “cancel” buttons, below). Use also for nav menus, sidebars, and dropdown menus.
- **Dangerous** A special case, that only applies a different appearance on hover and active. Use these to indicate an action the user should be wary of, most often something destructive to data. This variant can be combined with other button color variants.

See [Button colors](/docs/atoms-button-colors--primary) for details on customizing these.

### Disabled buttons

Use the `aria-disabled="true"` attribute on `anchor` elements, or the `disabled` attribute on `button` elements.

## Pressed, selected, current

Buttons can be given aria attributes to indicate to the user that they have a another state. This normally gives the user a little more information about how that button is intended to be used, or the effects it will have when clicked.

Apply `aria-pressed="true"` to your button to indicate that it’s a toggle button in a pressed state.

Apply `aria-selected="true` to the currently-selected tab button in a series of tab buttons.

Apply `aria-current="page"` to the navigation button in your main navigation, when the user is currently on that page.
