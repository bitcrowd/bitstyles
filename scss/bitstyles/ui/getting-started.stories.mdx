# Getting started

## Installing

Install bitstyles using yarn or npm:

```sh
yarn add bitstyles

# or

npm install bitstyles
```

Bitstyles is a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) library, so you’ll need to use Sass to build it. You could use the tools directly (see [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)). If you’re using webpack, use something like [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) for compiling.

## Updating

If you’re already using bitstyles in a project, you can update using npm. We stick to semantic versioning using major/minor/patch numbers, but as we’re talking about CSS classnames sometimes care is needed. We do not consider a changed classname a breaking change, but a changed classname can break your layout.

See the [CHANGELOG](../../../CHANGELOG.md) for details of updates you may need to make in your project when upgrading.

To update bitstyles while respecting the semantic versioning range specified in your package.json (change the version range before running this command if you need a version outside that range):

```sh
yarn upgrade bitstyles

# or

npm update bitstyles
```

If you want to jump straight to the latest version:

```sh
yarn add bitstyles@latest

# or

npm install bitstyles@latest
```

## Using bitstyles

Modern Sass offers a few ways of importing Sass. Which you should choose depends on the complexity of your configuration requirements. The following approaches are listed in order of complexity.

### Default configuration

In your main Sass file (e.g. `index.scss`), import bitstyles using `@use`. The exact path you use will be dependent on your setup, but assuming a default setup and install location:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

This will import the entire library, with default configuration.

You may need to provide your sass installation with the path for bitstyles’ sass. This should be:

```
node_modules/bitstyles/scss
```

### Simple configuration

Commonly you’ll want to change configuration — colors, typography, sizes etc. When making changes to these global design tokens, it can be done in the `@use` statement:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles' with (
  $color-palette-text: #fff,
  $color-palette-background: #000,
  $layout-size-base: 1.2rem,
  $margin-breakpoints: (
    'l',
    'xl',
  )
);
```

You could keep going like that, and reconfigure every module in bitstyles. But that single file starts to get unwieldy.

If you’re configuring only global design tokens, you may prefer to `@use` each settings file then import the library in one. Note the variable names must _lose the module-name prefix_ because the module’s scope is clear e.g. `$color-palette-text` is now `$text`.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/color-palette' with ($text: #fff, /* lots of options */);
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/layout' with ($size-base: 1.2rem, /* lots of options */);
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

### Advanced configuration

If you’re changing a lot of configuration, it’s recommended you switch to configuring bitstyles on a per-module basis.

A few things to note:

- you’ll need to import every part of bitstyles individually, whether you’re overriding variables there or not
- you could use that to selectively exclude modules you don’t need, to keep your bundle size down
- the variable names must _lose the module-name prefix_ because the module’s scope is clear e.g. `$color-palette-text` is now `$text`

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/color-palette' with (
  $text: #fff,
  $background: #000
);
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/layout' with (
  $size-base: 1.2rem
);

/* … */

@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/margin' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    'l',
    'xl',
  )
);
```

### Legacy `@import`

Although deprecated, Sass still supports the `@import` directive. Bitstyles can for now still be configured and built using this method, but it’s recommended that you use the `@use` approach shown above.

```scss
@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

You can configure bitstyles by defining variables before importing. Note the variables need to be prefixed with `bitstyles-`:

```scss
$bitstyles-color-palette-text: #fff;
$bitstyles-color-palette-background: #000;
$bitstyles-layout-size-base: 1.2rem;
$bitstyles-margin-breakpoints: ('l', 'xl');

@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

If you don’t need all of bitstyles, instead of importing the whole library you could define your variables then import the modules you need.

```scss
$bitstyles-color-palette-text: #fff;
$bitstyles-color-palette-background: #000;
$bitstyles-layout-size-base: 1.2rem;
$bitstyles-margin-breakpoints: ('l', 'xl');

@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/color-palette';
@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/layout';

/* … */

@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/color-palette';
```
