## Installing

Install bitstyles using yarn or npm:

```sh
yarn add bitstyles

# or

npm install bitstyles
```

Bitstyles is a [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) library, so you’ll need to use Sass to build it. You could use the tools directly (see [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)). If you’re using webpack, use something like [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) for compiling.

## Using bitstyles

In your main Sass file (e.g. `index.scss`), import bitstyles using `@use`. The exact path you use will be dependent on your setup, but assuming a default setup and install location:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

This will import the entire library, with default configuration.

You may need to provide your sass installation with the path for bitstyles’ sass. This should be:

```
node_modules/bitstyles/scss
```

## Configuration

Commonly you’ll want to change some configuration — colors, typography, sizes etc. When making changes to these global design tokens only, it can be done pretty simply in the `@use` statement:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles' with (
  $color-palette-text: #fff,
  $color-palette-background: #000,
  $layout-size-base: 1.2rem,
  $margin-breakpoints: (
    'l',
    'xl',
  )
);
```

If you’re changing a lot of configuration, including component and utitlity classes, you may want to switch to configuring bitstyles on a module basis. A few things to note:

- you’ll need to import every part of bitstyles individually, whether you’re overriding variables there or not
- you can use that to selectively exclude modules you do not need, to keep your bundle size down
- the variable names must lose the module-name prefix (e.g. `$color-palette-text` is now just `$text`, because the module’s scope is already clear)

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/color-palette' with (
  $text: #fff,
  $background: #000
);
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/layout' with (
  $size-base: 1.2rem
);

// …

@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/margin' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    'l',
    'xl',
  )
);
```

## Legacy `@import`

Sass still supports the `@import` directive. Though it’ll be deprecated and gone soon, bitstyles can for now still be configured and built using this method. It’s really recommended that you use the `@use` approach shown above though.

```scss
@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

You can also configure bitstyles this way, by defining variables before importing. Note the variables need to be prefixed with `bitstyles-`:

```scss
$bitstyles-color-palette-text: #fff;
$bitstyles-color-palette-background: #000;
$bitstyles-layout-size-base: 1.2rem;
$bitstyles-margin-breakpoints: ('l', 'xl');

@import '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles';
```

If you don’t need the whole library, after configuration you could import only the modules you need, instead of importing the whole library.
