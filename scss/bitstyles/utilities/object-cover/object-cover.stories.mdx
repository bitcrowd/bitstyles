# Object-fit Cover

This class is for elements with intrinsic size, such as an `<img>`, causing the element to expand to fill the available space **while maintaining their aspect ratio**. One dimension will overflow its parent as needed, in order to make sure the other dimension is filled.

The example uses an inline style to restrict one dimension, to mimic the reau-world case that one of the dimensions is constrained by your layout. Resize the viewport to see how the image is resized, but never stretched.

      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
