# Z (z-index)

Sets the z-index property.

By default, only `.u-z-1` is available. Note that you need to set a position other than the default `static` (probably either using `u-relative`, or by using component-level custom CSS to set `position: absolute`, `sticky`, or `fixed`), as otherwise CSS `z-index` has no effect.

Not available at any breakpoints when using the default configuration. See [customization](#customization) for details on how to change the configuration.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="z">
    {`
      <div class="u-relative u-z-1">.u-z-1</div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

The available z-indexes can be customized by overriding the `$bitstyles-z-index-values` map. Provide the name to be used for the class as the key, and the value:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/z-index' with (
  $values: (
    '1': 1,
    'modal': 10,
  ),
);
```

The breakpoints these classes are available at can be customized by overriding the `$bitstyles-z-index-breakpoints` list, providing the names of breakpoints from the global list of breakpoints:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/z-index' with (
  $breakpoints: ('s', 'm', 'xl'),
);
```
