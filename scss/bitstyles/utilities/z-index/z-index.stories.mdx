# Z (z-index)

Sets the z-index. By default, only `.u-z-1` is available. Note that you need to set a position other than the default `static` (probably either using `u-relative`, or by using component-level custom CSS to set `position: absolute`, `sticky`, or `fixed`), as otherwise CSS `z-index` has no effect.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="z">
    {`
      <div class="u-relative u-z-1">.u-z-1</div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

The available z-indexes can be customized by overriding the `$bitstyles-z-index` variable:

```scss
$bitstyles-z-index: (
  '1': 1,
  'modal': 10,
);
```

The breakpoints these classes are available at can be customized by overriding the `$bitstyles-z-index-breakpoints` variable:

```scss
$bitstyles-z-index-breakpoints: ('s', 'm', 'xl');
```
