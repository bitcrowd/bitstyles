# Height

Specify an elementâ€™s height. Default configuration provides `height: 100vh` and `height: stretch` (previously known as `fill-available`), with no breakpoint vartiants. See [customization](#customization) for details on how to change that.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="100vh">
    {`
      <div class="u-height-100vh u-bg-gray-10">
        u-height-100vh
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="stretch">
    {`
      <div style="height: 10rem">
        <div class="u-height-stretch u-bg-gray-10">
          u-height-stretch
        </div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

Customize the available heights by overriding the `$bitstyles-height-values` Sass map, providing the name to be used for the class, and the value to use.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/height' with (
  $values: (
    '10rem': 10rem,
  )
);
```

Available breakpoint variables can be specified by overriding the `$bitstyles-height-breakpoints` Sass list, providing a list of names of breakpoints taken from the global breakpoint list:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/height' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    'm',
  )
);
```
