# Visuallyhidden

## Hide an element visually, while leaving it readable & accessible by search engines & screenreaders

Use this to give more complete & understandable labels for UI and to help explain connections between content that may otherwise only be visually apparent e.g. visually display only 'next' on a button, but use `.u-visuallyhidden` to hide a span containing a more descriptive or specific label (see the markup below).

Available at every breakpoint set in `$bitstyles-visuallyhidden-breakpoints`.
