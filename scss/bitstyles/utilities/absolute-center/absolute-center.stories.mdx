# Absolute Center

Centers an element vertically & horizontally, relative to its closest non-statically positioned parent element (non-static most-likely means `relative`, but also `absolute` or `fixed`).

As this class makes use of absolute positioning, the element is no longer in the document flow and has no width or height as far as the parent element is concerned â€” the parent element must instead provide the dimensions for the `.u-absolute-center` to align to.

        <div class="u-absolute-center">This element is exactly centered within the parent element</div>
      </div>
    `}
