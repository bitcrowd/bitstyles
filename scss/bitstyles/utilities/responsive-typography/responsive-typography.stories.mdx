# Responsive typography

These are utility classes that apply responsive font-sizes from the typographic scale to an element. Using the default configuration, these mimic the responsive typographic scale used for the base elements, using font-sizes from you base design tokens. That results in elements that change font-size at different viewport sizes, making use of extra space and increasing visual contrast when space allows.

See [customization](#customization) below for details on how to change this.

In ideal cases, using the correct base elements (`h1`, `h2` etc.) should produce the typographic scale you need, but visual designs often call for a heading to have a font-size that doesnâ€™t match the correct order of HTML `<h>` elements dictated by the semantics of your document or app. Use these classes to override the font-size of the heading element to match your visual designs.

Resize your viewport to see how these elements change font-size at larger screen sizes.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Typography">
    {`
      <h3 class="u-h1">Header 1 (really an h3)</h3>
      <h3 class="u-h2">Header 2 (really an h3)</h3>
      <h2 class="u-h3">Header 3 (really an h2)</h2>
      <h3 class="u-h4">Header 4 (really an h3)</h3>
      <h3 class="u-h5">Header 5 (really an h3)</h3>
      <h3 class="u-h6">Header 6 (really an h3)</h3>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

The default configuration imports the styles set in [`settings/responsive-typography`](/docs/design-tokens-typography--page), so all configuration should happen there. This ensures these utility classes match the styles set in `base/typography`.
