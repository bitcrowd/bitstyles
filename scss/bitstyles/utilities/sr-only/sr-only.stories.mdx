# sr-only

## Hide an element visually, while leaving it readable & accessible by search engines & screenreaders

Use this to give more complete & understandable labels for UI and to help explain connections between content that may otherwise only be visually apparent e.g. visually display only “next” on a button, but use `.u-sr-only` to hide a span containing a more descriptive or specific label (see the markup below).

Available at no breakpoints by default, see [customization](#customization) for details on how to change that.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="sr-only">
    {`
      <button class="a-button">
        <span class="a-button__label">Next</span>
        <span class="u-sr-only">articles</span>
      </button>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

The class can be made available at various breakpoints by overriding the `$bitstyles-sr-only-breakpoints` Sass list, and including the names of breakpoints from the global breakpoints list:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/sr-only' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    'm',
  )
);
```
