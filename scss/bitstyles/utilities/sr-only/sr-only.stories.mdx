# sr-only

## Hide an element visually, while leaving it readable & accessible by search engines & screenreaders

Use this to give more complete & understandable labels for UI and to help explain connections between content that may otherwise only be visually apparent e.g. visually display only 'next' on a button, but use `.u-sr-only` to hide a span containing a more descriptive or specific label (see the markup below).

Available at every breakpoint set in `$bitstyles-sr-only-breakpoints`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="sr-only">
    {`
      <button class="a-button">
        Next
        <span class="u-sr-only">articles</span>
      </button>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
