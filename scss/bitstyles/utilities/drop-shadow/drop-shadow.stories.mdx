# Drop-shadow

Apply a drop-shadow to the element using CSS filters. By default this is selected from the standard set of shadows, but you can specify any shadow (see the [“Customization”](#customization) section below).

## u-drop-shadow

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story id="utilities-drop-shadow--brand-1" />
</Canvas>

## Customization

The available drop-shadows and their names can be customized by overriding the `$bitstyles-drop-shadow-values` Sass variable. Use the `shadows.get()` helper from `tools/shadows` to access the shadows you’ve setup in your global design tokens (see `settings/shadows`), providing `drop` as the format:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/tools/shadows';
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/drop-shadow' with (
  $values: (
    'brand-1': shadows.get('brand-1', 'drop'),
  )
);
```

The breakpoints these classes are available at can be customized by overriding the `$bitstyles-drop-shadows-breakpoints` variable:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/drop-shadow' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    's',
    'm',
    'l3',
  )
);
```
