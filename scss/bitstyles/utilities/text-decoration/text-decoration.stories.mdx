# Text-decoration

Set the `text-decoration-line` property on an element. With default configuration the available values are: `line-through` and `underline`, which are not available at any breakpoint. See the [customization](#customization) section for details on how to change the configuration.

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story name="u-line-through">
    {`
      <p class="u-line-through">Pastry marzipan gummi bears lollipop pie pie carrot cake dessert.</p>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-underline">
    {`
      <p class="u-underline">Pastry marzipan gummi bears lollipop pie pie carrot cake dessert.</p>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

The available text-align values can be customized by overriding the `$values` Sass variable:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/text-decoration' with (
  $values: (
    'overline': overline,
  )
);
```

The breakpoints these classes are available at can be customized by overriding the `$breakpoints` list, providing the names of the breakpoints from the global breakpoints list.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/utilities/text-decoration' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    'm',
  )
);
```
