# Typography

The default configuration provides typographic classes that apply all the font-sizes from the typographic scale, for all viewport sizes, and at the `m` breakpoint. See [customization](#customization) below for details on how to change that.

These are useful when you need to produce **exceptions** to the standard responsive typographic scale (see [responsiveness](#responsiveness), below), or when you need text with a fixed font-size at every viewport size.

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story name="u-text-1">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-1">u-text-1</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-2">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-2">u-text-2</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-3">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-3">u-text-3</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-4">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-4">u-text-4</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-5">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-5">u-text-5</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-6">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-6">u-text-6</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-7">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-7">u-text-7</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-8">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-8">u-text-8</div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Responsiveness

These classes are not responsive in the same way that the base heading elements or responsive typography utility classes are. Though available at various breakpoints (depending on your configuration), these utility classes won’t result in the element’s font-size changing at different viewport sizes — for that you should use the [responsive typography](/docs/utilities-typography-responsive--typography) utility classes.

With the default configuration, all the base font-sizes are available scoped to the `m` breakpoint:

<Canvas isColumn>
  <Story name="u-text-1@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-1@m">u-text-1@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-2@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-2@m">u-text-2@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-3@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-3@m">u-text-3@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-4@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-4@m">u-text-4@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-5@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-5@m">u-text-5@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-6@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-6@m">u-text-6@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-7@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-7@m">u-text-7@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="u-text-8@m">
    {`
      <div class="u-text-8@m">u-text-8@m</div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

What these classes are useful for is producing **exceptions** to the standardized responsive typography — perhaps you need a specific `<h3>` (or `.u-h3`) to have a different font-size than is standard, at a certain breakpoint.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="exception-example">
    {`
      <p class="u-text-4@m">A paragraph that becomes font-size “4” large at larger viewport sizes.</p>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customization

Override `$values` if you need to provide font-sizes outside of your base font-size design tokens, or a subset of those. But be aware this could lead to inconsistent type treatment — probably you should add the font-size you need to the base font-sizes instead.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/tools/font-size';
@use 'bitstyles/utilities/typography' with (
  $values: (
    'small': var(design-token.get('font-size', '1'),
    'custom': 5.192456rem,
  )
);
```

You can configure the breakpoints at which the classes are available by overriding `$breakpoints`:

```scss
@use 'bitstyles/utilities/typography' with (
  $breakpoints: (
    'm',
    'l',
  )
);
```
