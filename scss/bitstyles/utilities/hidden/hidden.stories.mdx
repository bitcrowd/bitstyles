# Hidden

## Hidden from everyone — you, search engines, screenreaders…

Fully hides an element & its children — it will be taken out of the document flow, and will not be read by search engines or screenreaders. If you need an element & its children to _always_ be hidden, you probably want to use the `hidden` HTML attribute, but if you need to hide elements selectively based on viewport size, this class is available at every breakpoint defined in `$bitstyles-hidden-breakpoints`.
