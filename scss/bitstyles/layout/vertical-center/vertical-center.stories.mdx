# Vertical Center

## Centers an element vertically

Centers the element vertically, relative to its closest positioned parent.

As this class uses absolute positioning, the element will be outside the document flow, and will have no inherent size â€” the parent element will need to specify its own height e.g. through being part of a flex layout.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Vertical center">
    {`
      <div class="u-bg--brand-2" style="min-height: 10rem;">
        <div class="l-vertical-center">Vertically-centered content here</div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
