# Content

## A generic wrapper for content with side padding and a maximum width

This layout object ensures:
- there is always whitespace at the sides of the viewport; content will never touch the edge.
- content spans the full width of the screen, up to a maximum set by `$bitstyles-content-max-width`
- content remains centred within its parent element.
