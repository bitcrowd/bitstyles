# Absolute Cover

This creates an element that completely covers its closest non-statically positioned parent element (non-static most likely means `relative`, but also `absolute` or `fixed`) from edge to edge. It forces the element to span edge-to-edge, however large or small and of any width/height ratio, making this likely suitable for images, media etc. (any elements with intrinsic dimensions  would look weird stretched).
