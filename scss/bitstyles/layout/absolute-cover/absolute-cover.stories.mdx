# Absolute Cover

An element that covers its closest non-statically positioned parent element (non-static most-likely means `position: relative`, but also `position: absolute`) from edge to edge. However large or small, and of any width/height ratio, so this may not be suitable for images, media etc. (any elements with intrinsic dimensions that would look weird stretched).
