# Topbar

A fixed-position element that sticks to the top of the viewport, often used for an always-present menubar.

The topbar spans the full width. Commonly used to contain site navigation, logo etc. Note that as it’s fixed, the main content element will need padding at the top to ensure it’s not obscured by the topbar.
