# Widths

A series of classes for specifying an element’s width, most commonly in combination with the [grid system](/?path=/story/layout-grid--grid).

They should also be used alone if setting an element’s width is needed, instead of defining widths in a new CSS component. Most of the time, this is still best done using the grid system.


### Dependencies

- `settings/widths`
- `tools/widths`

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Widths">
    {`
      <div class="l-width--2-of-12">
        <div class="u-bg--secondary">2-of-12</div>
      </div>
      <div class="l-width--4-of-12">
        <div class="u-bg--secondary">4-of-12</div>
      </div>
      <div class="l-width--6-of-12">
        <div class="u-bg--secondary">6-of-12</div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Make it responsive

The width classes are also available scoped to breakpoints — by default, just the `m`-sized viewports. This allows you to create an element that is displayed at different sizes based on viewport size. See the section on [responsive grid](/?path=/story/layout-grid--responsive-grid) systems for an example of the most common uses for this.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Widths (responsive)">
    {`
      <div class="l-width--2-of-12 l-width--6-of-12@m">
        <div class="u-bg--secondary">2-of-12</div>
      </div>
      <div class="l-width--4-of-12 l-width--2-of-12@m">
        <div class="u-bg--secondary">4-of-12</div>
      </div>
      <div class="l-width--6-of-12 l-width--4-of-12@m">
        <div class="u-bg--secondary">6-of-12</div>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Customisation

### Available widths

Set the `$bitstyles-widths` variable to define how many columns you need. To create multiple grid systems with different numbers of equal-width columns you can specify more than one column-count (most often only one is needed though) e.g. `$bitstyles-widths: (10, 12)` creates classes that can be used to split a row into 10 or 12 columns:

- `.l-width--1-of-10` … `.l-width--10-of-10`
- `.l-width--1-of-12` … `.l-width--12-of-12`.

### Breakpoints

You can override the definition of the `$bitstyles-widths-breakpoints` Sass list to contain the names of one or more breakpoints (it defaults to just `m`), to get widths that apply only at those breakpoints. They will follow the same format at the default breakpoint-scoped classes e.g. `.l-width--1-of-12@m`, `.l-width--6-of-12@l`…
