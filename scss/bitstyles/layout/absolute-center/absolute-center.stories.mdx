# Absolute Center

Centres an element vertically & horizontally, relative to its closest non-statically positioned parent element (non-static most-likely means `position: relative`, but also `position: absolute`).

As this class makes use of `position: absolute`, the element is no longer in the document flow and has no width or height as far as the parent element is concerned â€” the parent element must instead provide the dimensions for the `.l-absolute-center` to align to.
