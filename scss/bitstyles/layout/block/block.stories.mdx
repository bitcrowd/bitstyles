# Block

Forces an element to display as a block, even if it’s normally `inline` or `inline-block`. This can be used to force an inline element onto a ‘new line’, but also has implications for an element’s size (block elements expand horizontally to the available width).

    {`
      <span class="l-block u-bg--secondary">This is really a span element.</span>
    `}
