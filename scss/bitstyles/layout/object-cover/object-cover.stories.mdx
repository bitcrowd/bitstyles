# Object-fit Cover

Any element with inherent size (e.g. an `<img>`) will expand to fill the available space while maintaining their aspect ratio. One dimension will overflow its parent as needed in order to fill the other dimension.

The example uses an inline style to restrict one dimension, to mimic the real-world case that one of the dimensions is constrained by your layout. Resize the viewport to see how the image is resized but not stretched.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Object cover">
    {`
      <div style="height: 10rem">
        <img class="l-object-cover" src="https://placekitten.com/200/300">
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
