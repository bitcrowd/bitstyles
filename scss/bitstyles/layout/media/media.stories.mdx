# Media

## [Nicole Sullivan’s OOCSS media object](http:www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)

Contains a ‘feature’ element floated left e.g. a small user image. All other content (perhaps the user’s comment) flows around it to the right. The feature element should have either implicit size (like an image or video element), or have width set.

If the feature element is as wide as the viewport, any adjacent content will drop drown below it instead of ranging right.
