# Animation

Animations for many simple interactive state changes are defined globally in `settings/animation`. This simple system ensures that buttons, inputs, links etc. all transition with the same speed and easing function, with the minimum of maintenance.

The default values are:

```scss
$transition-easing: ease-in-out;
$transition-duration: 0.075s;
$transition-duration-long: 0.5s;
```

Note that there are two transition variables. The short transition-duration is by default used for fast and responsive-feeling user interactions such as hovering a button, link, or input. The second is present to standardize larger transitions of content (e.g. a modal or sidebar), where a short transition may be jarring.

## Using animation settings in Sass

`@use` the settings module in your component Sass file, then access the variables in the standard Sass way:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/animation';

.component-class {
  transition-duration: animation.$transition-duration;
}
```

## Customization

Override the values for these animation variables at the start of your Sass manifest file.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/animation' with (
  $transition-easing: ease-in-out,
  $transition-duration: 0.075s,
  $transition-duration-long: 0.5s
);
```
