# Color palette

The global color palette is used throughout the components and utility classes of bitstyles to maintain visual consistency.

By default the palette includes variants of the following colors:

```scss
$black: #000;
$white: #fff;
$brand-1: #000dff;
$brand-2: #fa0;
$text: #333;
$background: color.mix($white, $brand-1, 97%);
$positive: #50a802;
$danger: #e82915;
$warning: #fe881e;
```

For each of these colors we generate a map of color variants with white added (made available with the name of the color) and a map with black added (available with the name of the color suffixed with `_shades`).
