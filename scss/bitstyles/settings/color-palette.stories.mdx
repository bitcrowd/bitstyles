# Color palette

Bitstyles provides a semantically-named color palette, with each color having a scale of named variants from `dark-4` to `light-4`. These colors are used to create the components and the color-related utility classes like background-color, border, and color. A `color-palette.get()` helper function makes using them in your projects easy.

<Story id="base-colors--color-palette" />

## Using the color palette in Sass

Use the `palette.get()` helper function for accessing colors in your Sass. Import `tools/palette`, then use the `get()` function. Pass the color name and variant you want, as parameters:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/tools/palette';

.component-class::after {
  background-color: palette.get('brand-1', 'light-1');
}
```

With the default setup this will output:

```css
.component-class::after {
  background-color: #4d56ff;
}
```

### `palette.get()` parameters

| Name   | Type   | Description                                              |
| ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| $color | string | The name of the color                                    |
| $key   | string | The variant of that color you want. Default is `"base"`. |

## Using colors with classnames

Use the appropriate utility classes to apply colors. See the documentation of each class for information on defaults & customization:

- [`u-fg` (color)](/docs/utilities-color--brand-1)
- [`u-bg` (background-color)](/docs/utilities-background-color--background)
- [`u-border`](/docs/utilities-border--border)

## Using the color palette in CSS

The color palette is also available as CSS custom properties. In the default configuration, they are namespaced with `bs`, see [setup](/story/design-tokens-setup--page):

```css
--bs-color-brand-1-light-3: #ded9ff;
--bs-color-brand-1-light-3-rgb: 222, 217, 255;
--bs-color-brand-1-light-1: #b2a6ff;
--bs-color-brand-1-light-1-rgb: 178, 166, 255;
--bs-color-brand-1-base: #9485ff;
--bs-color-brand-1-base-rgb: 148, 133, 255;
// …
```

Note that each color is also output as rgb tuples, to make using them in CSS color functions a little easier e.g. `rgba(var(--bs-color-brand-1-light-3-rgb), 0.5)`

## Using color-palettes in JS

The color design tokens can be imported and used in JS:

```js
import colorPalette from '../exports/_color-palette.scss';

console.log(colorPalette['brand-1.light-3']); // '#ded9ff'
console.log(colorPalette['brand-1.light']); // '#b2a6ff'
console.log(colorPalette['brand-1.base']); // '#9485ff'
// …
```

## How the system works

The color system in Bitstyles is a three-tier design token system:

- Base colors
- Base palette
- Semantic palette

The **base colors** are a small list of colors from which we generate the base palette.

The **base palette** consists of a large number of tints (versions of the colors with extra lightness in the HSL color space) and shades (versions of the colors with less lightness in the HSL color space) generated from the base colors.

In the default configuration, these are named with numbers from `5` (darkest) to `195` (lightest) in intervals of 5, with `100` being the base color itself. Due to the way the color adjustment works, color `200` would always be pure white, and color `0` would always be pure black, so they’re not included. That also means that if you want a balanced scale (not necessarily important), the lightness of the base color you provide should be approximately 50% in the HSL color space.

The base palette is used during setup to configure our **semantic palette**, which is what’s used throughout the codebase to apply colors to components, and for any utility classes that apply color. The base palette is not to be used outside of setting up this semantic palette.

The semantic palette is your final source of truth for colors in your project. If a color doesn’t exist here, it should not be used in your components or utility classes. It’s a limited list of semantically-named colors, selected from those base color palettes, providing colors with meaningful names such as `background-light`, `background-dark`, `danger-base`, `danger-light`.

The default configuration includes a few colors that are not from the generated

This three-tier system is intended to offer a wide range of color options with minimal setup, while encouraging use of a small tightly-controlled palette of colors in your final codebase. That helps to maintain both visual and code consistency, and reduces the potential for color bloat.

If you have a specific set of colors you need to use, and cannot rely on generated scale to match those, you can skip the base colors and/or the base palette entirely, and just specify your colors in the semantic palette.

## Base colors

By default the palette includes variants of the following colors:

<Story id="base-colors--base-colors" />

For each color, 39 variants are generated from `5` to `195`. Lower numbers indicate darker colors.

There are two special cases:

- The `pure-gray` palette offers a scale of 25 colors from black to white, 0 to 100 respectively.
- The `accent-gray` colors are a grayscale backgrounded with a color (your brand-1 color by default).

<Story id="base-colors--base-palette" />

## Customization

### Base colors

The color variants in the base color palette are generated from a set of initial base colors. Changing those base colors will change the variants generated from them. For example changing the brand-1 color to pure red will generate color variants of red.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/base-colors' with (
  $colors: (
    'brand-1': #f00,
  )
);

/* brand-1 colors:

(
  "1": #fffcfc,
  "2": snow,
  "3": #fff7f7,
  "4": #fff5f5,
  "5": #fff2f2,
  "10": #ffe6e6,
  "20": #ffcccc,
  "30": #ffb3b3,
  "40": #ff9999,
  "50": #ff8080,
  "60": #ff6666,
  "70": #ff4d4d,
  "80": #ff3333,
  "90": #ff1a1a,
  "100": red,
  "105": #f20000,
  "110": #e60000,
  "120": #cc0000,
  "130": #b30000,
  "140": #990000,
  "150": maroon,
  "160": #660000,
  "170": #4d0000,
  "180": #330000,
  "190": #1a0000
)
*/
```

Note that if you wish to retain the other colors, you’ll need to copy them from the default configuration and provide them here, as these sass lists are immutable.

You can add new colors not present in the default Bitstyles configuration, by defining them here, but you’ll then need to update the base-palette to use those new colors.

### Base color palette

#### Changing the scale

Change the lightness values at which the colors of the base color palettes will be generated by overriding:

- `base-colors.$color-scale-percentages`
- `base-colors.$grayscale-percentages`

These are a Sass lists with number values for the percentages of the color to be mixed. The numbers will also be used as the label for the variant. `$color-scale-percentages` is used to generate most of these colors; `$grayscale-percentages` is used to generate the 0–100 grayscale.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/base-colors' with (
  $color-scale-percentages: (
    '10': 10,
    '50': 50,
    '90': 90,
    '110': -10,
    '150': -50,
    '190': -90,
  )
);

/* brand-1 colors:
(
  "10": #ebebf7,
  "50": #9d9bd5,
  "90": #4f4bb3,
  "110": #35329a,
  "150": #1e1c56,
  "190": #060611,
)
*/
```

### Override the base palette

Override the base palette to customize the generated colors. `tools/color` provides `generate-tints-and-shades` and `generate-scale` functions to make this easier, but you can also manually specify colors. It’s recommended you use the colors specified in the base-colors layer, but it’s not required:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/tools/color';
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/base-color';
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/base-palette' with (
  $color-palette: (
    'red': color.generate-tints-and-shades($base-color: map.get(base-colors.$colors, 'red')),
    'blue': color.generate-tints-and-shades($base-color: #00f),
    'custom-color-scale': (
      '0': #355322,
      '1': #986282,
      // …
    ),
  )
);
```

## Semantic Color palette

All the colors of the base palette are available to you to construct the semantic palette. If the default colors are not suitable, or if changes to the base colors or base color palette mean the colors used by default in the semantic palette are no longer suitable, override the semantic palette. You must overwrite the entire thing, so be sure to copy the colors you’ll use even if you don’t change them.

It’s recommended that you select the colors from the base palette, but it’s not required:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/tools/base-color';
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/color-palette' with (
  $color-palette: (
    'brand-1': (
      'default': base-color.get('brand-1', '70'),
      'light-1': base-color.get('brand-1', '30'),
      'dark-1': base-color.get('brand-1', '170'),
    ),
    'blue': (
      'default': #00f,
      'dark-1': #006,
    ),
  )
);
```

### Default key

With the default configuration, `base` is the root for each color, allowing you to use e.g. `palette.get()` without specifying a color variant when you want the base color e.g. `palette.get('brand-1')`. To change the default key, override `color-palette.$default-key` with the string you wish to use.
