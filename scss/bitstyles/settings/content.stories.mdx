<Meta title="Design Tokens/Content" />

A semantic-level design token used to describe the horizontal spacing of content. Used in [`atoms/content`](/docs/atoms-content--a-content) and [`atoms/flash`](/docs/atoms-flash-overview--page) to ensure the content of those components is always correctly aligned to each other.

The default configuration is responsive — on small viewports, the amount of horizontal space around content is fairly minimal, while on larger viewports it’s increased.

## Customization

Configure your content padding in a mobile-first way — first provide the spacing for all viewport sizes, then override that as necessary at one or breakpoints. Here we just specify larger padding for `m` -sized viewports, but you can add as many breakpoints as you need.

```scss
@use 'bitstyles/settings/content' with (
  $padding: (
    '#{setup.$no-media-query}': (
      'base': size.get('s1'),
      'l': size.get('m'),
    ),
    'm': (
      'base': size.get('l1'),
      'l': size.get('l1'),
    ),
  )
);
```
