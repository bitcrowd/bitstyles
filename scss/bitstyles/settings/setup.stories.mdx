# Setup

There are a few global variables that are useful in rare cases to avoid conflicts. These are bundled together in `settings/setup`.

## Namespace

Useful if you need bitstyles to coexist with other CSS libraries, if you specify a namespace all the bitstyles classes will be prefixed with it.

```scss
@use 'bitstyles/settings/setup' with (
  $namespace: 'bs'
);
```

Will result in classnames which all start with `bs`, followed by the CSS layer abbreviations, then the class name:

```scss
.bs-a-card {
}
.bs-u-padding-0 {
}
```

## “No media query” name

When you pass a block of CSS content to the `media-query.get()` helper, it wraps that content in a media-query. To make looping over media-queries easier, there is a special-case media-query name that results in no media query wrapper. This defaults to `no-mq`, and can be configured using `$bitstyles-setup-no-media-query`:

```scss
@use 'bitstyles/settings/setup' with (
  $no-media-query: 'base'
);
```

This is useful if you need a media-query with the name `no-mq` for other purposes.
