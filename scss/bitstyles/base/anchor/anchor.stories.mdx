# Anchor

Links navigate the user to another URL. They are the magic sauce that make the web web-like, and are one of the original HTML elements: `<a>`. Use these anchor elements for your links, using the `href` attribute to provide the URL to navigate to. When doing this, you don’t need any extra classes, just the semantic HTML:

<Canvas>
  <Story id="base-anchor--base" />
  <Story id="base-anchor--disabled" />
</Canvas>

Apply `aria-disabled="true"` to give the link a disabled appearance, but be aware that the link will still function — the `href` will still be honored by the browser, and the user will navigate to that URL when they activate the link.

## Link states

Available states are:

| State    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| default  | The default appearance of the button variant, without any user interaction                                                                                                                                        |
| hover    | The user has their cursor over the button (`:hover` psuedoclass)                                                                                                                                                  |
| active   | The user is currently clicking, tapping, or otherwise activating the button (`:active` psuedoclass)                                                                                                               |
| visited  | This indicates to the user that they have previously visited this URL                                                                                                                                             |
| disabled | The button is not currently clickable, and will not perform an action when clicked. If this is applied to a button rendered as an anchor element (using `aria-disabled`), that element will however be clickable. |

## Customization

The color and underline properties for links can be configured by overriding `settings/link`. These styles will be applied to `<a>` elements and [Atoms/Link](/docs/atoms-link-overview--page).

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/settings/link' with (
    $color: palette.get('brand-1', 'dark-1'),
    $background-color: transparent,
    $text-decoration: underline,
    $box-shadow: none,

    $color-hover: palette.get('brand-1', 'dark-1'),
    $background-color-hover: transparent,
    $text-decoration-hover: underline,
    $box-shadow-hover: none,

    //…
  );
```

The following properties are available for each state:

| Property name      | Description                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `color`            | The link’s `color` property           |
| `background-color` | The `background-color` property       |
| `text-decoration`  | The link’s `text-decoration` property |
| `box-shadow`       | The `box-shadow` property             |
