# Animation

Animations for many simple interactive state changes are defined globally in `design-tokens/animation`. This simple system ensures that buttons, inputs, links etc. all transition with the same speed and easing function, with the minimum of maintenance.

The default values are:

```scss
$transition-easing: ease-in-out;
$transition-duration: 0.075s;
$transition-duration-long: 0.5s;
```

Note that there are two transition variables. The short transition-duration is by default used for fast and responsive-feeling user interactions such as hovering a button, link, or input. The second is present to standardize larger transitions of content (e.g. a modal or sidebar), where a short transition may be jarring.

## Using animation settings in Sass

`@use` the settings module in your component Sass file, then access the variables in the standard Sass way:

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/design-tokens/animation';

.component-class {
  transition-duration: animation.$transition-duration;
}
```

## Using animation settings in CSS

The animation design tokens are also available as CSS custom properties. In the default configuration, they are namespaced with `bs`, see [setup](/story/design-tokens-setup--page):

```css
--bs-transition-duration: 0.075s;
--bs-transition-duration-long: 0.5s;
--bs-transition-easing: ease-in-out;
```

## Using animation settings in JS

The animation design tokens can be imported and used in JS:

```js
import animation from '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/exports/_animation.scss';

console.log(animation['easing']); // 'ease-in-out'
console.log(animation['duration']); // '75ms'
console.log(animation['duration-long']); // '0.5s'
```

## Customization

Override the values for these animation variables at the start of your Sass manifest file.

```scss
@use '~bitstyles/scss/bitstyles/design-tokens/animation' with (
  $transition-easing: ease-in-out,
  $transition-duration: 0.075s,
  $transition-duration-long: 0.5s
);
```
