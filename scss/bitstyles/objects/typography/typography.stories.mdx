# Typography

Typographic classes that mimic the html elements `<h1>` – `<h6>`, these are useful when your visual design calls for a specific font-size, but following the correct order of HTML `<h>` elements would result in a different size.

Note the `.o-h0` has been added as an additional layer above `.o-h1`, use it to acheive extra-large ‘hero’ text.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Typography">
    {`
      <h1 class="o-h0">Header 0 (really an h1)</h1>
      <h2 class="o-h1">Header 1 (really an h2)</h2>
      <h3 class="o-h2">Header 2 (really an h3)</h3>
      <h4 class="o-h3">Header 3 (really an h4)</h4>
      <h5 class="o-h4">Header 4 (really an h5)</h5>
      <h6 class="o-h5">Header 5 (really an h6)</h6>
      <h5 class="o-h6">Header 6 (really an h5)</h5>
    `}
  </Story>
