# Typography

## Typographic classes that mimic the html elements `<h1>`..`<h6>`

This means you can use the semantically correct element in your markup then apply the correct class to achieve the correct visual appearance.

Note the `.o-h0` has been added as an additional layer above `.o-h1`, use it to acheive extra-large ‘hero’ text.
