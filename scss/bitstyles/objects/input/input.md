# Form inputs

## Base styling for input elements

All inputs stretch to fill their parent â€” their width is constrained by the parent element.

## Inputs - text

## All inputs that accept a string input e.g. text, email, number, date

Includes styles for focus, active & disabled states.

## Inputs - Checkbox

Base styling for checkboxes. Not much can be done here, but size and spacing are set.
