# Nav Button

A button object that looks like a link in your main navigation (and must be an acnhor element), but has the niceties of our button classes.

Hereâ€™s a base nav button. Note that it expects to be rendered on a dark background. Most likely this will be a navbar.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button--dropdown">
    {`
      <div class="u-bg--black-80 u-padding-m">
        <a href="/" class="o-button o-button--nav">
          Dashboard
        </a>
      </div>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
