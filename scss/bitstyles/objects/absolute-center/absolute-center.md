# Absolute Center

## Centres an element vertically & horizontally

Positioned relative to its closest non-statically positioned parent element.

This object class makes use of `position: absolute` so the element is no longer in the document flow and has no width or height as far as the parent element is concerned â€” the parent element must instead provide the dimensions for the `.o-absolute-center` to align itself to.
