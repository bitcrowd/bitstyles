# Icon Button

## A button with only an icon as visible content

A specialised button type â€” (visible) content is intended to be only an icon. Commonly used for share buttons (facebook, twitter etc.).

Provide a `visuallyhidden` span containing descriptive text next to the icon element so the button has valid text to use as button label (see example markup).
