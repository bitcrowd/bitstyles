# Overflow

## Vertical scrolling panel

Any vertical overflow on the element is allowed to scroll, horizontal overflow is not. The height of this element will need to be restricted somehow — the example here shows an inline style for simplicity, but in practice that should handled by your layout e.g. a flex-based layout.

Different browsers/OSes have different strategies for displaying scrollbars when they’re needed, this class standardises that behavior and ensures no scrollbars are displayed unless there’s something to scroll.
