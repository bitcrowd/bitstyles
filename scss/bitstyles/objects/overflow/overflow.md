# Overflow

## Vertical scrolling panel

Any vertical overflow on the element is allowed to scroll, horizontal overflow is not.

Different browsers/OSes have different strategies for displaying scrollbars when they’re needed, this class at least ensures no scrollbars are displayed unless there’s something to scroll.
