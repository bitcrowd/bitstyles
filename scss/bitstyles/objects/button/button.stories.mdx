# Buttons

## Buttons perform actions

The button classes are used to make an interactive element look like a “button” to the user, and should ideally perform an action rather a navigation. For historical and technical reasons, things which we consider “actions” are actually implemented by navigating to a page (e.g. a CRUD system) so this class is often applied to `<a>` elements. Ideally though (and definitely if you’re working on a JS app) use a real `<button>` element.

## Button

All the buttons produce a larger-than-text hit target, and by default react to `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`, and `:disabled`. Visited states are not shown even if the button is an anchor, as “visited” doesn’t make sense for an action.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button Element">
    {`
      <button class="o-button" type="button">
        <span class="o-button__label">Button element</span>
      </button>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="Button (Disabled)">
    {`
      <button disabled class="o-button" type="button">
        <span class="o-button__label">Button element (disabled)</span>
      </button>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="Anchor Element">
    {`
      <a href="#" class="o-button">
        <span class="o-button__label">Anchor element</span>
      </a>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="Anchor Element (visited)">
    {`
      <a href="/" class="o-button">
        <span class="o-button__label">Anchor element (visited)</span>
      </a>
    `}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Buttons with icons and text

**Note**: if you want a button with _only_ an icon, go look at [`button--icon`](/?path=/docs/objects-button-icon--button-element)

These are buttons containing a visible text label next to an icon. The order of text/icon is dictated by the order of the elements, you do not need to add a class to change it.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Button with Icon">
    {`
      <button class="o-button" type="button">
        <svg class="o-button__icon o-icon" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="20" height="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" aria-hidden="true">
          <path d="m55.94 1.03v43h43v12h-43v43h-12v-43h-43v-12h43v-43z" fill-rule="evenodd"/>
        </svg>
        <span class="o-button__label">Button with icon</span>
      </button>
    `}
  </Story>
  <Story name="Button with Icon (reversed)">
    {`
      <button class="o-button" type="button">
        <span class="o-button__label">Button with icon (reversed)</span>
        <svg class="o-button__icon o-icon" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="20" height="20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" aria-hidden="true">
          <path d="m55.94 1.03v43h43v12h-43v43h-12v-43h-43v-12h43v-43z" fill-rule="evenodd"/>
        </svg>
      </button>
    `}
  </Story>
