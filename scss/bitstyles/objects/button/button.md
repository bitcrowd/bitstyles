# Buttons

## Buttons perform actions (they’re not links, nor navigation), and are ideally a `<button>`

Out of technical necessity this class can be applied to `<a>` elements.

## Button - generic

**Produces a larger-than-text hit target**. Intended to be an action, not a link, therefore most often a `<button>` rather than `<a href="…">` (and never `<a href="#">`).

## Button - with icon

**The same base button can contain an optional decorative icon**.

Here it’s placed before the text. Source order dictates icon position. There must be no whitespace between the icon and text — can be achieved using comments as shown here.

## Button - with icon, reversed

**The same base button can contain an optional decorative icon**. Here it’s placed after the text. Source order dictates icon position.
