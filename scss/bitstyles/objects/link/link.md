# Link

Mimicking the appearance of standard anchor elements e.g. allows a `<button>` to look like a link.

This is generally a bad practice — if it looks like a link, it should be a link — but it’s sometimes necessary for technical reasons e.g. it can’t be a link because no url change occurs when displaying a modal or similar.

This is always code smell but is sometimes necessary.
