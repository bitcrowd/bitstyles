# Truncate with ellipsis

## When text content is wider than parent width, truncate text with an ellipsis (…)

The parent element needs a set or limited width.

Note the exact algorithm is defined per browser and is of varying quality — you may lose a couple of characters just to display an ellipsis instead.
