    #WIDTHS
\*------------------------------------ */

/**
 * A series of width helper classes that you can use to size things like grid
 * systems. Classes can take a fraction-like format (e.g. `.u-2/3`) or a spoken-
 * word format (e.g. `.u-2-of-3`). Use these in your markup:
 *
 * <div class="u-7/12">
